# stellar Mobile App

>IMPORTANT: This is an updated/refreshed version of the stellar_mobile repo. Use this one.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. From the root of this directory, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install packages

### Running the app

- `react-native run-ios` to start the app in the simulator

- [Follow these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html) to run the app on a device

>NOTE: The camera (in src/components/Question/RecordAnswer.js) will only work on a device. In the simulator it will just be a black screen and won't execute callbacks.

## Notes

* Use Deepfreeze to protect against mutability in tests

* Use Expect library to make test assertions
